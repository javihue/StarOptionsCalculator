# StarOptions Calculator

A calculator GUI that allows users to determine the cost of a reservation within the Westin & Sheraton timeshares, using the Vistana Signature Network StarOptions point system. 

## Purpose

For timeshare owners within the Vistana Network, the only way to know the cost of a possible reservation if it is currently unavailable to be booked, is to manually calculate the cost using a document titled [StarOptions Value Charts](https://vistana-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/vistana-web/assets/pdf/charts/staroptions_value_chart.pdf). The document is straightfoward, but calculations can become complex for longer stays, as points vary by day of the week, by week of the year, and by section of a resort.

The StarOptions Calculator can determine the points needed for any possible vacation within the Vistana Network system's rules, and only requires 4 data points to provide all possible results based on the criteria selected. (Location, Date, Length of Stay, Type of Room)

## Using the StarOptions Calculator

The calculator requests user input (Resort location, Check-in date, Length of stay & Type of villa) using multiple dropdowns in a window form. By clicking on the "Search" button, the application will return a list of results based on the input. Each result includes the resort selected, the section of the resort (if multiple sections within a resort), a brief description of the type of villa selected, and the total number of points needed to book the reservation.
